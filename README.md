# Eros.jl

_Written as an overkill submission to a first-year applied maths project at UCT._

This program computes simple in-plane transfer orbits between geostationary orbits of two solar, in-plane, celestial objects orbiting the sun.

### Using the script

- Install Julia
- Download `eros.jl`
- In a command prompt with the current directory set to the location of `eros.jl`, run `julia eros.jl`
- Follow the prompts to select your desired journey to another planet/asteroid and back
- Read off when, for how long, and with what changes in velocity will be required to complete the journey
